Assembly manual hints
---------------------

If you don't feel confident enough, try to assemble to USB test PCB first.

1) Power Supply
----------------
Start with USB connector, you can verify connection with test points (FIXME
which ones). Populate C1,C3,U1,Q2. Verify that 5V test point is not connected
to GND and to 3V3. If not, you can try to attach 5V via usb and test 3.3V are
present on test point FIXME.

2) Optional Power stability Capacitors C12, C13
-----------------------------------------------
FIXME decide whether really needed for the workshop


3) Debug LED 
------------

Populate R5 and D5. Keep in mind LED polarity (FIXME add some hint according
to actula LEDs that will arrive).
If the MCU (U2) is not soldered you can
test LED by connecting TP (FIXME which one) to GND.
 If the MCU is already soldered, and the power is applied it might flash the
LED, but as the boot selection circuit is not yet the MCU might not start yet.
You can then test the LED by briefly connecting the test point to GND.

3) Boot selection Circuit
--------------------------
At least C11, R13 and R16 needs to be soldered to relyably boot the MCU.
Bootloader can be then started by shorting the J14.
If SW3, C10 and Q1 is populated, then SW3 can be used either to reset mcu
(short press) or entering bootloader (long press).

3) MCU
------

If not presoldered solder the MCU (U2). If the preprogrammed MCU was used, the LED should blink 
once the power is applied.

4)External MCU clock (optional)
------------------
HSE (High Speed Clock), Y1 is needed for the USB to work. LSE (Low Speed
Clock), Y2,Cx,Cx (FIXME) are needed for RTC. None of this is needed for this
workshop, but it's easier to solder now, than on the complete kit.


4) LED Matrix driving
---------------------
Solder R3, U3,U4,U5. Use the LED matrix as the holder for soldering the
"precision socket headers" for LED matrix on the other side.
If the LED matrix is oriented correctly the demo should be visible if power
applied.

6) Buttons (optional)
-----------
This is optional, has no use in the workshop demo and can be done later on,
but it's easier to do before the side headers are soldered.
SW1 and SW2 can be soldered for future use, R2, R14, C2, C4 form the hardware
button debounce.


5) interface headers
--------------------
The headers J1,J2,J4,J5,J6,J7,J8,J9 needs to be soldered now.
If possible use a test jig, or another PCB to have the headers perpendicular
to the PCB board.

Now you should have everything needed for the workshop

Eventually you can add C6 to C9 for better MCU stability in noisy environment.
Assemble the the mechanical LED matrix mount and the bolts.. etc. FIXME?
