## What is this?

A STM32F070CB driving a LED DotMatrix.

## Prerequisities for building Firmware

  * You need an appropriate Cortex-M ARM toolchain. We suggest to use the
  ARM's [GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm ](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
  Please note that the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` provided by Ubuntu 18.04 is currently broken and can't be used.

  * This project makes use of [libopencm3]()https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) and [ChibiOS](http://www.chibios.org).
  In order to build `libopencm3` you need `Python 2`.

  * To download the firmware, you have two options:
     - Via USB: You need `dfu-util 0.9+` and a USB cable. Please not that `dfu-util 0.8` will not work.
     - Via SWD: You need `openocd` and a `ST-LINK v2 device`
  
  * Optional: `Docker`

You might be interested in some [libopencm3 examples here](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples).

The pull requests there might be an interesting source of information as well.

You will also want to have the manuals for your hardware at hand. These are the most important for software development:
 - Peripherals, memory layout, registers ... : [STM32F030x4/x6/x8/xC and STM32F070x6/xB MCUs](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00091010.pdf)
 - Pinouts, Electric Characteristcs, HW variants, clocks ...:
   [STM32F070CB Product Specification](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f070cb.pdf)
 - Exceptions (NVIC), instructions ... :

## Install & Build

Get the code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/Yanisin/DotMatrix.git

We provide a Dockerfile, containing the suggested toolchain, openocd, dfu-util and other tools as well.
You can build the container with:

    $ cd DotMatrix/
    DotMatrix$ docker build -t gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4 .

Create a file named `settings.mk` in `DotMatrix/src` and provide an appropriate configuration.
You can use `DotMatrix/src/settings.mk.example` as input. This `settings.mk` works with the Docker container:

```
OPENCM3_DIR ?= /home/dev/app/src/libopencm3
CHIBIOS ?= /home/dev/app/src/ChibiOS
HW_VERSION = "HW_60x60_rev_0_5"
SUDO=
SIM=0
OOCD ?= openocd
OOCD_INTERFACE ?= stlink-v2-1
OOCD_TARGET ?= stm32f0x
```

You can start the container with:

    DotMatrix$ docker run -it --privileged --expose 4444 \
                  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
                  -v `pwd`/../libopencm3:/home/dev/app/src/libopencm3 \
                  -v `pwd`/../ChibiOS:/home/dev/app/src/ChibiOS \
                  -v `pwd`:/home/dev/app \
                  gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4:latest /bin/bash

You need to compile `libopencm3` before usage. This has to be done once.
With help of the toolchain container this is:

    dev@59e291eed30d:~/app$ cd src/libopencm3/
    dev@59e291eed30d:~/app/src/libopencm3$ make

ChibiOS is compiled on demand.

To compile the firmware / demo of your interest, just go to the directory and issue `$ make`. For instance:

    dev@59e291eed30d:~/app$ cd src/full/
    dev@59e291eed30d:~/app/src/full$ make

This should result in a binary `build/full.elf`.

### Content of the package

The software demos live in the src directory. There are are three main demos
avaiable:

- `src/stm32f070_miniblink` - a simple demo just blinking the LED
- `src/GameOfLife` - GameOfLife with all connected cells working together.
  Simple communication protocol over UART. The demo uses just libopencm3
  for HW interfacing.
- `src/full` - the 'catch all' demo. Includes GameOfLife and other applications
  that are selectable with an 'applet selector'. Provides a communication
  layer over I2C and UART. Automatically detects the topology of the boards
  at startup and chooses a 'master board'. Is based on an RTOS (ChibiOS).

There are also other small testing projects and a simulator that allows you to
run the 'full' demo on your host machine.

## Flashing

Flashing is done using the `make prg` and `make prg_usb` commands.
See `src/common.mk` for other makefile commands.

### SWD Interface

Attach the SWD interface of the MCU via stlink-v2 programmer and issue `$ make prg`

### USB DFU Bootloaders

There are two USB bootloaders.  One is burnt int the MCU from the manufacturer.
This one can be used in case of emergency to write "more specialized" bootloader stored 
in the FLASH, and that is used the flash the actual firmware.

The MCU itself has a bootloader burnt from the manufacture. This one requires
the Y1 oscillator popullated in order to work. It can be

#### Project Distributed Bootloader

There is a bootloader in `src/dfu`. Among other nice features this bootloader
allows to flash multiple interconnected boards at the same time.
Once compiled it can be flashed to ieach of the MCUs either using the stlink-v2
programer ( using `make prg` commad) or via the MCUs built in bootloader (using
the "make prg_bl" command).

If you want to use this bootloader (recommneded way), issue `$ make prg_usb` in
your project and connect the board over USB (or restart it, if it is already
connected. The flashing process will start as soon as the board reaches the
bootlader (you will see threee dots). If multiple boards are connected and
started at once, the firmware will be loaded to all of them.

The USB part of this bootloader seems to work even without Y1 resonator
populated, but the manufacturer does not say that it should be relyable.
If you have the the Y1 not populated keep this in mind.

#### MCU Manufacturers Bootloader

The MCU has a built in bootloader that is started if the BOOT0 pin is held hight
after reset is released. On the board there is reset circuitry with button.
If you hold this `reset` button for several seconds, you will get the board into
manufacturer provided bootloader. Among other ways (like USART, SPI, I2C) this
bootloader can program the flash via the USB DFU protocol. Use `make prg_bl` to
talk to this bootloader.  This can be used to flash the project bootloader or
have the wonderfull feeling of running bare-metal. If you want to run your
project without the project bootloader, You have to compile the demo with
`NO_BOOTLOADER=1`. 

Keep in mind that you can use this bootloader in USB DFU mode only if there is
the Y1 resonator present. If the Y1 is not present, you will need to use the
stlink-v2 or some other interface that this bootloader can handle even without
oscillator.  For details about this bootloader search for STs AN2606.

## Memory layout

Even though that you are programming C, it is important to know the memory
layout for debugging etc. The makefiles will take care of linking the code
at correct addreses.

ROM is mapped at 0x08000000 and the layout is as follows:

 Address | Size     | Usage
---------|----------|------------------------------------
0x0      | 0x4000   | Project Distributed Bootloader
0x4000   | 0x1C000  | Your application code (interrupt vectors, .text, .data)


RAM is mapped at 0x20000000 and the layout is as follows.

 Address | Size     | Usage
---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------
0x0      | 0x100    | Interrupt vectors (loaded from ROM)
0x100    | 0x3F00   | Your application data (.data loaded from ROM, .bss)

For the location of IO registers for peripherals, consult the ST manual


# Hardware and mechanical parts
The currently used/latest HW is described in "pcb/60x60_dma". The board
is designed with KiCAD but there is the schematics exported in PDF 
and some assembly hints with list of needed parts are added as well.
The other folders in "src" are mostly unfinished various experiments/extension.

In the "mechanical" folder you can find the mechanical parts for 3D printing.
For each board PCB you will need one disp_support.stl.  The file is expected to
be printed with 0.4mm nozzle and 0.15mm layer height.  For connecting boards
you can use joint_cross_1_5m.stl for each corner (in older revision of the
board there is LED in the way so you need the use the one with the cuts for the
LED).
